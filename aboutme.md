title: About me
---

I am a developer by hobby who has a great interest in procedural content generation. This blog is a place for me to write about my experiences and projects mostly related to this topic.

At some point this may evolve into a game development blog as well, depending on how successful and time-consuming the initial work is.

My contact details are located hereabouts, likely in the footer of the homepage. For the most part this site is still under construction, this will probably be the last page I update once said construction is finished so if you're reading this, there is still background work going on.

In realspace I work in London, in one of the many pillars of financial services. I should state that my views here are my own and not representative of anyone else's, including my employer, friends, family, etc. just a general disclaimer.
